Backend development for an e-commerce platform with Python and Flask. Responsible for the service architecture behind catalog, dynamic pricing, and order processing in an environment with seasonal traffic spikes.

Key outcomes

- Architected the order engine with an explicit state machine, optimistic stock validation, and idempotent operations that eliminated double-processing in payments.
- Designed a dynamic pricing system with configurable rules per category and promotion, supporting bulk updates with zero downtime.
- Optimized catalog performance under load (composite indexes, materialized views, cursor-based pagination) with ~40% response time improvements.
- Built an integration test suite with reproducible fixtures covering full purchase flows and concurrency edge cases.
