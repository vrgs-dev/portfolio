Current role as a senior full-stack developer at a software factory, making architecture decisions and leading technical delivery for multiple client products in parallel.

Focus and outcomes

- Defined per-project backend architecture (modular monolith vs. microservices) based on expected volume, budget, and team size, prioritizing incremental delivery.
- Full-stack development with complete ownership: from domain modeling and APIs to React/Next.js interfaces, ensuring coherence across layers.
- Implemented multi-layer caching strategies (in-memory, Redis, HTTP) and critical query optimization, keeping response times stable as each product's user base grows.
- Technical coordination with product and design teams, translating business requirements into actionable engineering tasks with clear estimates and trade-offs.
