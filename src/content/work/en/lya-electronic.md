Returned to LA Electronic as a senior freelance to lead the evolution of the backend platform. Redesigned legacy systems I had originally built years earlier, applying lessons learned in scalability and resilience.

Highlights

- Refactored the original monolith into decoupled modules with clear responsibilities, reducing onboarding time for new developers and the surface area for regressions.
- Redesigned the authentication flow to short-lived tokens with refresh rotation, eliminating zombie sessions and strengthening security posture without impacting UX.
- Implemented async processing with message queues for heavy tasks (reports, ERP sync), freeing up the event loop and improving stability under load.
- Mentored the junior team through code reviews, testing standards, and architecture sessions for design decisions.
