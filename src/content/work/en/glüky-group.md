Backend development on a distributed team, working on digital products with high user concurrency. Main focus was decomposing a monolith into a service-oriented architecture and establishing production observability practices.

Impact highlights

- Led the progressive migration of critical monolith modules into independent Node.js services, reducing deploy blast radius and enabling per-team releases.
- Implemented a distributed caching layer (Redis) and resolved N+1 query patterns, achieving ~30% p95 latency reduction on highest-traffic flows.
- Designed and integrated an observability pipeline (structured logs, business metrics, SLO-based alerts) that cut mean incident detection time from hours to minutes.
- Defined internal API style guides and documented contracts with OpenAPI, improving cross-team collaboration between frontend and backend.
