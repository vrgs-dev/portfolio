First full-time backend role. Took ownership of building the company's internal services from scratch, defining the coding standards, API contracts, and data models that remain in use today.

Core contributions

- Designed the relational schema for inventory, customers, and billing, including versioned migrations and constraints that eliminated recurring data inconsistencies.
- Built the authentication and authorization system with JWT and role-based permissions, reducing unauthorized access incidents to zero on sensitive operations.
- Standardized REST contracts (input validation, error codes, pagination) that were adopted as the foundation for every service built afterward.
- Integrated payment gateways and third-party services with circuit breakers and controlled retries to ensure transactional consistency.
